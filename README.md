# User_Registeration-Login

This is a user registeration / login program. Currently you have 2 options. The first option is to sign up as a new member. The program will ask you for a username and a password. Then it will check if it is strong enought (Currently checking if the input is 8 characters or longer, will update for stronger security in the future). Then it will store the input and output all the data to the designated files (Username.txt  and  Password.txt)

After you have signed up as a member, you will have the option to login as a member. Again, the program will ask for your username and password which are stored in the files. Then, it will check whether they match. If not, it will ask you to login again or just create a new account all together.

In a future update, a "forget password" feature will be added. From that point on, when creating a new account, it will also ask for an input that will remind you of the password. This feature will be implemented in the future.
